<h3>CSV Input Files</h3>

<p>The input for the Magic Square tool is a CSV file. CSV stands for Comma Separated Values, and the file should have one line for every term or item to be included in the square. Each line will have two items separated by a comma. For this reason, if you need a comma included in your definition, you will need to encase it in quotation marks. For example, here are some possible CSV lines</p>

<pre><code>Water, liquid that covers 70% of the planet Earth
US flag colors, &quot;red, white, and blue&quot;
Texas, greatest state in the union
</code></pre>

<p>Also be aware that certain characters must be encoded using HTML character encoding in order to display properly. For things you would need to insert as a symbol, like a &deg;, &Delta;, &Lambda;, &Sigma;, &copy;, you must encode them properly. You can find character encodings for these entities on various sites across the Internet, one such reference being: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/entities.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/entities.html</a>. </p>

<p>If you plan on using the 5x5 magic square, you will need 25 items. If you prefer, you can make a smaller (3x3) grid with 9 items, or a larger one (7x7) with 49 items. This tool only supports odd-numbered squares. </p>

<p>The CSV file may be created using a variety of software programs. Microsoft Excel is commonly used, is great for importing data from other sources, but sometimes formats cells in a way that causes errors in the output. Consider using a more rudimentary tool like Wordpad or Notepad. These programs will provide less formatting and give a &#8220;cleaner&#8221; look at what you are setting up. Just make sure that your file name has the extension CSV (letters after the period that identify the file type). </p>

<p>Another consideration: The first column (usually column A in Excel) will become associated with the letter in the magic square, and the second column will be used to fill the number side of the worksheet. Columns can easily be moved in Excel, and if you decide that one item makes more sense in a particular position, that’s how to control it. You might start with the word as the first column and the definition in the second.</p>

<p>You can use this tool for an endless variety of activities, from an engaging way to introduce new information to a fresh look at items to be studied for review. Just to give you a quick example, and possibly one you would use with students in guided practice, I am providing &#8220;MathFacts.CSV&#8221;. This has 25 very simple math problems, whose answers range (exactly) from 1 to 25. Working the magic square involves finding the math problem on the right that provides the answer for each letter on the left. Once you figure out which items pair up, just write the number from each pair onto the box with that letter on the answer sheet. </p>

<p>Note that this should be self-correcting for students – if they add up all the boxes in each horizontal row, every row should get the same sum, and that is the same for all the columns (like a Sudoku). The diagonals DO NOT add up to the same value however. Students should be able to validate that their square has been correctly completed, and if they are close, the rows and columns with errors should be fairly easy to spot. </p>

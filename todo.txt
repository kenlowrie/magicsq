Things left To Do - yfi=G8Pb}+R-

1. Add CSS to format the MKMS output so that it works correctly on iOS
1e. Add a button to show the magicsquare.php file (for debugging). Will this be necessary after I finish 2a?

2. Add custom CSS for each print form/page.
2a. Make is so Generate Quiz Data does all the validation, etc., and then has a button/link to create output.
2b. Make is so you can regenerate a single jumble set or square. (reload the same page and pass in the info for reset?)

3. Output is: see the ONE SQUARE.pdf file
4. Output is: Generate a key (List format and also a filled out square with letters and numbers.)
5. Output is: Generate a study list?
6. Validate: # terms is correct for MSSIZE


4. Add Stephen's algorithm for generating the square based on start position and start number
99. Should we worry about students hitting the site and reverse engineering the puzzles?
